When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When collaborating with other people on a project or when using multiple computers to work
on a project.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

In case there are changes made on both Git and the local repository, pulling manually
ensures that changes pulled are the ones that are wanted.
