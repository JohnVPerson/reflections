When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When collaborating with other people on a project or when using multiple computers to work
on a project.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

In case there are changes made on both Git and the local repository, pulling manually
ensures that changes pulled are the ones that are wanted.



Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one
instead of another?

A fork is a copy of another person's repository that is stored on GitHub, a clone is a copy
of a repository saved to a local host, and a branch is a seperate version of a 
repository that can be edited to add experimental features not intended to be released
with a master branch until it is finished. Forks would be used to copy another person's
repository while giving credit to the original poster. Clones would be used if work is being
done to a repository on different computers. Branches would be used to implement a new feature
that can be later merged to the master.
